# CPCBasic Apps Collection

[CPCBasicApps](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasicApps/) is a collection of CPC BASIC apps.
They can be run on a Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128, in an emulator or with
[CPCBasic](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasic/) or
[CPCBasicTS](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasicTS/).

When you start programs from this collection, a compiled version of [CPCBasicTS](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasicApps/dist/index.html) is used.

The initial upload for a app should be in its "original" state.
Afterward, it may be adapted to run with CPCBasic, CPCBasicTS, or other fast emulators.

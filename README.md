# CPCBasic Apps Collection

[CPCBasicApps](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasicApps/) is a collection of CPC BASIC apps.
They can be run on a Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128, in an emulator or with
[CPCBasic](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasic/) or
[CPCBasicTS](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasicTS/).

(TODO: If you start the programs from this collection, a compiled [CPCBasicTS](https://benchmarko.github.io/CPCBasicApps/dist/index.html) is used.
 Local link: [CPCBasicTS](./dist/index.html) )

[HTML Readme](https://github.com/benchmarko/CPCBasicApps/#readme),

The initial upload for a app should be in its "original" state.
After that it can be adapted to run with CPCBasic, CPCBasicTS or other fast emulators.
